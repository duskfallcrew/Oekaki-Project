## Installation

#### Instructions for Users

Install Python: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

Clone the Repository: Download or clone the repository that contains your Oekaki application.

It's reccomended if you're a nerd to use Git clone 

However, for this instance, just download the code as a zip file and unzip into a new folder.

Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages using pip. This will install PyQt6, which is used for the GUI.

pip install pyqt6

Run the Application: Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Oekaki application.

python oekaki.py

#### HELP! My canvas isn't here!

Select a canvas size in the left hand toolbar, and it will automatically resize the window. Please note, the color mixing box is not implimented yet.

#### Explanation:

PyQt6: This package is essential for building the GUI of the application.


## Plans

- Looking to create an Oekaki styled program that's useable offline.
- Customizable with user plugins.
- Light on memory, light on resources.
- Simple sized canvases, with limited options, as this is not meant to be a large scale drawing app.
- Possibly have callbacks for social media sharing.

## Current Issues
All current issues have been solved, just working on long term things. Consider this an always work in progress!

## Next Steps

- Tool-Specific Behaviors: Implement distinct behaviors for each tool.
- Gradient and Paint Bucket Tools: Add functionalities for these tools.
- Tablet Pen Recognition: Recognize and handle tablet pen input.
- Themes (Dark/Light Mode): Implement dark and light modes.
- Additional Dialogs: Create dialogs for help, about, importing brushes/colors, and making suggestions.


## Is it coded yet?

Partially. Again we're not CODERS nor programmers, so when we get dumb tiny ideas we go to ChatGPT and ask it how easy it is to make stuff..

And now we're on our third toy in a week.

It may not be *AS* lightweight but there's some fun features we're looking into, so if you want to be involved with this dumb idea feel free!

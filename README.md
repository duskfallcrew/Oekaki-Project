# Oekaki-Project
A project opting to make an Oekaki styled program that's lightweight and open source. 

## Plans

- Looking to create an Oekaki styled program that's useable offline.
- Customizable with user plugins.
- Light on memory, light on resources.
- Simple sized canvases, with limited options, as this is not meant to be a large scale drawing app.
- Possibly have callbacks for social media sharing.

## Next Steps

- Tool-Specific Behaviors: Implement distinct behaviors for each tool.
- Gradient and Paint Bucket Tools: Add functionalities for these tools.
- Tablet Pen Recognition: Recognize and handle tablet pen input.
- Themes (Dark/Light Mode): Implement dark and light modes.
- Additional Dialogs: Create dialogs for help, about, importing brushes/colors, and making suggestions.


## Is it coded yet?

Partially. Again we're not CODERS nor programmers, so when we get dumb tiny ideas we go to ChatGPT and ask it how easy it is to make stuff..

And now we're on our third toy in a week.

It may not be *AS* lightweight but there's some fun features we're looking into, so if you want to be involved with this dumb idea feel free!

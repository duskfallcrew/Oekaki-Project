# Oekaki-Project
A project opting to make an Oekaki styled program that's lightweight and open source. 

## Plans

- Looking to create an Oekaki styled program that's useable offline.
- Customizable with user plugins.
- Light on memory, light on resources.
- Simple sized canvases, with limited options, as this is not meant to be a large scale drawing app.
- Possibly have callbacks for social media sharing.


## Is it coded yet?

No. But i'm working on plans first, unlike the dataset tool maker I made - this is something that's more long term. 
Expect me to probably have a first iteration within a week though, because It's a dopamine thing LOL.

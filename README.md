## Plans

- Looking to create an Oekaki styled program that's useable offline.
- Customizable with user plugins.
- Light on memory, light on resources.
- Simple sized canvases, with limited options, as this is not meant to be a large scale drawing app.
- Possibly have callbacks for social media sharing.

## Current Issues
- Cursor movement doesn't match where the brush goes
- Canvas DOES resize with window, but i'm not sure we want that  as it causes some issues in the UI/UX
- Brushes don't do much YET
- Unsure what needs to be imported for end user as we have most of the imports installed.

## Next Steps

- Tool-Specific Behaviors: Implement distinct behaviors for each tool.
- Gradient and Paint Bucket Tools: Add functionalities for these tools.
- Tablet Pen Recognition: Recognize and handle tablet pen input.
- Themes (Dark/Light Mode): Implement dark and light modes.
- Additional Dialogs: Create dialogs for help, about, importing brushes/colors, and making suggestions.


## Is it coded yet?

Partially. Again we're not CODERS nor programmers, so when we get dumb tiny ideas we go to ChatGPT and ask it how easy it is to make stuff..

And now we're on our third toy in a week.

It may not be *AS* lightweight but there's some fun features we're looking into, so if you want to be involved with this dumb idea feel free!
